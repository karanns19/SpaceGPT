A light year is a unit of measurement used in astronomy to describe the distance that light travels in one year. Since light travels at a speed of approximately 186,282 miles per second (299,792,458 meters per second), a light year is a significant distance â€” about 5.88 trillion miles (9.46 trillion km). "
